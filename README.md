Acceptance Criteria 


The script should take as input: 

·         A full path to a directory. 

·         A regular expression. 

The job of the script is to scan all “.txt” files in the provided directory for lines matching the provided regular expression. 

The script should produce as output: 

·         The file name and line number of lines matching the regular expression. 

o    When a file contains multiple matching lines, only the first matching line for that file should be returned. 

·         The output can be console/stream output. Or it can be written to a file. 

The script should only inspect “.txt” files in the provided directory. It should not recursively scan subdirectories.
